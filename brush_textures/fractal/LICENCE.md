Here are some seamless fractal-textures for you.
Made with Apophysis 7x.15B :)

Feel free to use them for whatever comes to your mind.

For those who want to use them with the DC_image Plugin for Apophysis, I have included a folder named "Images" containing high contrast B/W-Bitmaps of the textures.
To use them in Apophysis, just copy this folder in the same folder where Apohysis is located and be sure you have DC_image in your Plugins-folder.

If you need some suitable gradients too, you can find them here: [link]

You don´t have to credit me if you don´t want to, but I want you to have fun. ;)
